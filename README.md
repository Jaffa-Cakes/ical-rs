# rust-vcard-ical

This is a library to parse the iCalendar format defined in rfc5545, as well as similar formats like vCard.

The initial goal was to make a porting of the [mozilla parser](https://github.com/mozilla-comm/ical.js) from Javascript to Rust. The main logic come from this codebase,but is adapted to the Rust paradigms.
